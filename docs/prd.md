*A PRD (Product Requirements Document) is created before creating a product or feature and includes the planning required for developers to execute effectively. This document is usually prepared by Product Managers, read more [here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements)*

# Product Requirements Documentation

**Summary**
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Project Name | {Put Project Name Here}|
| Description | {One sentence summarizing what is the app and why it matters} |
| Developers | {List of Developers} |
| Live Website | {website of deployed application} |
| Repo | {Link to git repository} |

## Problem Being Solved and Target Market

Use this area to explain what problem your app is solving, and who are the people who have this problem.

## User Stories

List of stories users should experience when using your application.

- Users should be able to see the site on desktop and mobile
- Users can create an account
- Users can sign in to their account
- Users can create a new item
- Users can see all their items on the dashboard
- Users can update items
- User can delete items

## Route Tables

For backend Applications you'll want to detail the different routes and types of your request your server can receive. There are three main things to define.

- The endpoint: the URL to which the request must be made
- The method: the type of http method the request should be
- The response: what the response should be, a web page, json data, etc.

You should also include any additional notes on any special headers that may be used and so forth.

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Other |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| /item | GET | JSON of all items | |
| /item | POST | Create new item return JSON of new item | body must include data for new item |
| /item/:id | GET | JSON of item with matching id number | |
| /item/:id | PUT | update item with matching idea, return its JSON | body must include updated data |
| /item/:id | DELETE | delete the item with the matching id | |
| /auth/signup | POST | creates new user account returns user JSON | new user info must be included in body |
| /auth/login | POST | logs in user and returns user JSON with JWT token | username and password must be included in body |

## Component Architecture

You can use the [Mermaid Markdown Syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart) to create a chart of how the parts of your frontend website relate to each other. Units should represent components of your page.

```mermaid
