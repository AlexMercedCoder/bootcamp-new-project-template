## Bootcamp Project Repo Template

This is a template for helping build your project in a coding bootcamp. The main purpose of this is to help you to write quality documentation. Documentation is written in md files using markdown syntax wich you can see [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## [Product Requirements Document(PRD)](./docs/prd.md)

This document should be filled out before starting your project to help you think through what your building. 

## Documenting Challenges and Solutions - Issues

Whenever you run into an issue you should create an issue on your repository (you'll issues in the menu at the top of the screen). Create the issue and make comments as you learn new things to solve the problem. This becomes something that can help you and other users in the future.
